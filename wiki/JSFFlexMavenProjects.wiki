= Introduction =

This page will contain brief info regarding the maven projects of JSF Flex.


= Details =


==jsf-flex-build-plugIn==
A plug-in project that utilizes qdox open source project to inspect the {{{JavaDocs}}} in order to generate replaceMapping XML for jsf-flex/renderKit14 project. Also it will generate componentValueMapper.xml for jsf-flex-shared/core project by inspecting the {{{JavaDocs}}} or annotations for renderKit14 project or renderKit15 project respectively. Currently there exists a Hack to always use renderKit14 project, because qdox open source project has an issue when parsing Java files with annotations.


==jsf-flex/core==
Contains code pertinent to JSF components. Since the project uses myfaces plug-in, tld, faces_config.xml, tagClass, and etcetera are created during build time.


==jsf-flex/core-mojarra-impl==
Contains following list of classes specific to Mojarra impl as MXML_BASIC renderkit needs to wrap HTML_BASIC renderKit {in order to allow usage mixing of MXML + HTML components}, but there exists a difference in how Mojarra + {{{MyFaces}}} impl adds HTML_BASIC renderkit to the factory :
 * MXMLRenderKitFactoryImplWrapper.java
 * MXMLRenderKitImpl.java
 * MXMLRenderKitImplWrapper.java
 * MXMLResponseStatemanagerImpl.java
 * MXMLResponseWriterImpl.java


==jsf-flex/core-myFaces-impl==
Contains following list of classes specific to {{{MyFaces}}} impl as MXML_BASIC renderkit needs to wrap HTML_BASIC renderKit {in order to allow usage mixing of MXML + HTML components}, but there exists a difference in how Mojarra + {{{MyFaces}}} impl adds HTML_BASIC renderkit to the factory :
 * MXMLRenderKitFactoryImplWrapper.java
 * MXMLRenderKitImpl.java
 * MXMLRenderKitImplWrapper.java
 * MXMLResponseStatemanagerImpl.java
 * MXMLResponseWriterImpl.java


==jsf-flex/examples==
A WAR project containing sample jsf pages for the project.

==jsf-flex-shared==
A project containing shared resource for other projects.

==runnerImpl/commonTaskRunnerImpl==
Contains projects that implement the {{{_CommonTaskRunner}}} interface used by jsf-flex-shared/core {i.e. sdkStandardCommonTaskRunnerImpl project}

==runnerImpl/fileManipulatorTaskRunnerImpl==
Contains projects that extends the {{{_FileManipulatorTaskRunner}}} abstract class used by jsf-flex-shared/core {i.e. velocityFileManipulatorTaskRunnerImpl project}

==runnerImpl/flexTaskRunnerImpl==
Contains projects that implement the {{{_FlexTaskRunner}}} interface used by jsf-flex-shared/core {i.e. antFlexTaskRunnerImpl project}

==jsf-flex/renderKit14 JRE < 1.5==
For renderKit14, during the build time documentation for java files will be inspected by the JSF Flex plug-in and will generate replaceMapping XML files that will be parsed to check which fields to inspect and how to fetch these fields from the JSF component {by attribute map or by method invocation]. Contains an implementation of {{{_AnnotationDocletParser}}} interface used by jsf-flex-shared/core for fetching the fields from the JSF component, {{{AnnotationDocletParser14Impl}}} }

==jsf-flex/renderKit15 JRE > 1.4==
Since these components are suppose to be used for JRE >= 1.5, the attributes will be fetched during runtime through Java annotation and will not require JSF Flex plug-in during build time. Contains an implementation of {{{_AnnotationDocletParser}}} interface used by jsf-flex-shared/core for fetching the fields from the JSF component, {{{AnnotationDocletParser15Impl}}}.

==jsf-flex/annotations JRE > 1.4 ==
This maven project contains the annotations from other maven projects, such as from jsf-flex/renderKit15 maven project.
