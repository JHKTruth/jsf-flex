The project itself has been componentized tremendously in order to provide :
 * flexibility in choosing the implementation preferred {i.e. if the institution using this component library only allows ANT implementation, one should choose {{{antFlexTaskRunnerImpl}}} as the project for implementing {{{_FlexTaskRunner}}} interface}
 * in order to follow the IOC design pattern.

The choice of implementation is driven through profiles when executing the mvn build.
