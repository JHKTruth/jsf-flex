==Dependencies between JSF Flex projects' projects==
 
===jsf-flex/core===
 * jsf-flex-framework-core
 * jsf-flex-shared
 * jsf-flex-framework-component14 or jsf-flex-framework-component15

===jsf-flex/examples===
 
   

==Dependencies between JSF Flex project and other open source projects==
JSF Flex project currently has dependencies from following list of open source projects :
 * myfaces-api
 * myfaces-impl
 * myfaces-shared-impl
 * myfaces-builder-plugin
 * tomahawk
 * tomahawk-sandbox
 * commons-logging

==Methods of triggering different artifacts/dependencies for the project==
 * *mvn install* will provide default artifacts with component14 {JRE < 5} Jar file and {{{DefaultRunnerFactoryImpl}}} being instantiated during runtime for {{{_RunnerFactory}}} abstract class. Which will subsequently instantiate concrete classes for the following interfaces from the following list of projects respectively :
   * {{{_CommonTaskRunner}}}		sdkStandardCommonTaskRunnerImpl
   * {{{_FileManipulatorTaskRunner}}}	velocityFileManipulatorTaskRunnerImpl
   * {{{_FlexTaskRunner}}}		antFlexTaskRunnerImpl
 * *mvn install -Djsf_flex_framework_runtime=15* will provide the same artifacts as *mvn install* with the exception that component15 {JRE >=5} Jar file will be linked as the frameworks components.
 * In future, providing an argument of following syntax *mvn install -Drunner_factory_impl=<implementation_class>* will allow a different implementation of {{{_RunnerFactory}}} to be linked during build time.
 * *mvn install -Djsf=12* will allow usage of myfaces1.2 dependency to be linked.
