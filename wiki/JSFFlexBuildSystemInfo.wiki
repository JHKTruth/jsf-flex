==Methods of triggering different artifacts/dependencies for the project==
 * *mvn install* will provide default artifacts with renderKit14 {JRE < 1.5} Jar file and {{{DefaultRunnerFactoryImpl}}} being instantiated during runtime for {{{_RunnerFactory}}} abstract class. Which will subsequently instantiate concrete classes for the following interfaces/abstract class from the following list of projects respectively :
   * {{{_CommonTaskRunner}}}		sdkStandardCommonTaskRunnerImpl
   * {{{_FileManipulatorTaskRunner}}}	velocityFileManipulatorTaskRunnerImpl
   * {{{_FlexTaskRunner}}}		antFlexTaskRunnerImpl
 * *mvn install -Djsf_flex_renderKit_runtime=15* will provide the same artifacts as *mvn install* with the exception that renderKit15 {JRE >= 1.5} Jar file will be linked.
 * In future, providing an argument of following syntax *mvn install -Drunner_factory_impl=<implementation_class>* will allow a different implementation of {{{_RunnerFactory}}} to be linked during build time.
