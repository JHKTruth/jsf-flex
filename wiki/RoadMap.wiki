==Work to be done==
------
JSF Flex goal is to provide users capability in creating standard Flex components as JSF components. In order to provide quality product for the users, the project must support :
 * various operating systems 
   * Windows
   * Linux
   * Mac
 * various browsers
   * Firefox
   * IE
   * Opera
   * Safari
 * various servlet container/application servers
   * {{{TomCat}}}
   * {{{JBoss}}}


==Milestones==
------
===Release 0.5 ALPHA===

====Release Date====
TBD

====Planned====
 * Support of JSF 2.0
 * Support of latest,stable Flex version {i.e. 4.0}, so plan is to upgrade components from mxml to spark, those that apply. But this change of course will be abstracted to the user of jsf flex tags. However, if the user chooses to use mxml components rather than recommended spark components, user can provide an attribute within the tag to apply the namespace change.
 * Because of the additional namespace + possible additional namespace that Flex might receive in the future, there will be a mark up + name change for the tags + classes from MXML to Flex. Though it will require refactoring of the code, this is to allow users to be abstracted from one version to an another {i.e. components such as Button will be changed to use spark rather than mxml and if future changes will occur within Flex the changes will be transparent to the user while using the upgraded versions}.
 * Capability of using {{{MethodExpression}}} for additional components.
          o Asynchronous data update event listener for listening to a specific event of a source Flex component, so that when it is triggered target Flex component's value is updated with the value returned from an asynchronous call that is bound by MethodExpression on the server side.
 * Additional functionality such as the current DataGrid component where there will be further interweaving of JSF/Java + ActionScript content.
 * Removal of unnecessary core-mojarra-impl + core-myFaces-impl Jar files
 * Attributes for JSP + XHTML will need to be provided as sub-tag of the tag. Meaning other than fields which are project specific or data bound to the component, attributes should be provided as a sub-tag of the component {Can consider it to be attribute node of the node element}
 * Possibly Eclipse plugin for attributes lookup

===Release 1.0.1 BETA===

====Release Date====
December 10, 2009

====Accomplished====
 * Change from usage of Qdox Javadoc to Annotation
 * Code written in JDK 5.0
 * Support of Flex version 3.4 {i.e. {{{DateChooser}}} component and locale support according to the change needed of copyLocale execution for Flex version 3.x}
 * Capability to submit the form data using mxmlButton or mxmlLinkButton tags
 * Tweaking of performance { usage of Executors in some of the tasks to possibly assist in creation of multiple SWF + locale; however swc + swf creation is dependent upon Flex SDK }
 * Capability in creating components outside of JSF Flex by providing the component name + attributes as tag attributes
 * *One thing to note is the size of the download artifacts. Since Flex SDK now comes packaged with Air tools to allow creation of Air applications for Flex components, the size of flexSDK has been increased rather largely {that's the reason the first hit to any .xhtml or .jsf page will take a bit of time, but afterward the time should be relatively similar when hitting additional pages to create SWF, SWC, and etcetera within debugMode. please note that when one is done, one should change the configuration to productionMode to see it's actual performance}. There exists two reasons of why Air library hasn't been ripped out of flexSDK that is downloaded with the Jars : 
     * First is for safety, meaning it is better to leave them in then to find out later that one needs certain Jars that has been removed
     * Second is a possible investigation of creation of Air. Strong emphasis on possible.*
===Release 1.0 BETA===

====Release Date====
Approximate target date is April 15, 2009

====Accomplished====
Currently the project supports most of the Flex standard components as well as functionalities that have been added on for JSF application { {{{i.e. DataGrid components can have their data bounded to managedBeans, so that large information will be partitioned into batches and the pieces of the information being fetched asynchronously through ActionScript}}} }. Brief testing has been done on Windows XP operating system with the following list of browsers :
 * Firefox 2.0
 * IE 6.0
 * Opera 9.25
on application server {{{TomCat}}} 6.0 and {{{JBoss}}} 4.2.
This release supports Flex 2.

====TODO====
 * Complete testing on remaining OS, browsers, and application servers must be performed, so to support every type of user.
