==Work to be done==
------
{{{JavaServer}}} Faces Flex's goal is to allow users in creating dynamic Flex applications with simply their knowledge of JSF. In order to provide quality product for the users, the project must support :
 * various operating systems 
   * Windows
   * Linux
   * Mac OS X
 * various browsers
   * Firefox
   * IE
   * Opera
   * Safari
 * various application servers
   * {{{TomCat}}}
   * JBoss
   * WAS
For the 1.0 release, plan is to support all the Flex standard components, which have been open sourced through MPL license.


==Milestones==
------

===Release 0.5===

====Release Date====
N/A

====Accomplished====
Currently the project supports most of the Flex standard components with exception to {{{DataGrid}}} component, since the intent is to set and retrieve the values of this component by services. Brief testing has been done on Windows XP operating system with the following list of browsers :
 * Firefox 2.0
 * IE 6.0
 * Opera 9.25
on application server {{{TomCat}}} 5.5.

====TODO====
 * Complete testing on remaining OS, browsers, and application servers must be performed, so to support every type of user.
 * {{{DataGrid}}} component must be implemented as a service.
 * Possible nesting of mx:Application within h:form should be attempted. Currently it has been nested outside the form element due to failure of initial attempt in referencing the SWF file within the form element for IE browser.
